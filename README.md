# RIESLING Examples
Repository with examples of how to use [riesling](https://github.com/spinicist/riesling)

Three notebooks are included
- Tutorial
- Tikhonov Regularization for SENSE reconstructions
- ESPIRiT Reconstruction for Dead-Time gap filling

These can be run interactively on mybinder.org. In order to let them run within the 2 gig memory limit, you should change the matrix size to 64 isotropic instead of 128. This can be found at the top of the notebooks - look for the `mat = 128` line.

And an example using the data from the ISMRM reproducibility group CG-SENSE reconstruction challenge in `rrsg_cg-sense`.

More to come soon. Stay tuned!
